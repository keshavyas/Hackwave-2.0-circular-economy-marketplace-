# Hackwave-2.0-circular-economy-marketplace-
“A platform where we all earn together by giving new life to old things — that’s the power of our Circular Economy Marketplace.”
Circular Economy Marketplace aka (Reclaim Circle Hub )is a platform that encourages people to share, donate, and exchange items they no longer use—promoting a circular economy within local communities. Users can list items they want to give away or browse available resources offered by others. The goal is to reduce waste, promote sustainability, and build a community-driven sharing culture where resources are reused instead of discarded.
